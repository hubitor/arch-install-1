This install script intends to streamline the installation process of Arch
Linux; it will automate file editing and creation, and some system-wide
configurations. It intends to be POSIX-compliant and follow the Installation
Guide [1] whenever possible.

It can be run with the following one-liner on Arch Linux's live media shell,
`zsh`, that features process substitution [2]. One cannot pipe `curl` to `sh`,
since the script needs a lot of user input.

    # sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco)

Some caveats about the installation:

  * when using old installation media, the script will fail to parse
    names of countries correctly from the mirrorlist, and `pacman`'s
    keyring may be outdated, preventing package installation. as such,
    these need to be updated before the script is executed:

    # pacman-key --refresh-keys
    # curl -o /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/

  * to change the mount folder, use the following command:

    # sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco | sed "s|/mnt|$MOUNTPOINT|g")

  * to change the EFI system partition size, use the following command
    for installation (use valid `parted` units [3]):

    # sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco | sed "s/100M/$BOOTSIZE/g")

  * likewise, to change the `home` partition size, use:

    # sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco | sed "s/100%/$HOMESIZE/")

  * if using UEFI, the bootloader installation step can be ignored
    entirely by telling the motherboard to boot Arch directly [4]

One can save the script locally and customize other aspects of the
installation if needed.
